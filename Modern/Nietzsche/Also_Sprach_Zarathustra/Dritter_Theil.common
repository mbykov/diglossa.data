Thus Spake Zarathustra

Third Part

"Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation, and I look downward because I am exalted.

"Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?

"He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all tragic plays and tragic realities."

--ZARATHUSTRA, I., "Reading and Writing."
