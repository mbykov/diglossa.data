We reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood
Upon the second buttress of that mount
Which healeth him who climbs. A cornice there,
 
Like to the former, girdles round the hill;
Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.
Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth
 
The rampart and the path, reflecting nought
But the rock's sullen hue. If here we wait
For some to question, said the bard, I fear
 
Our choice may haply meet too long delay.
Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
He fastn'd, made his right the central point
 
From whence to move, and turn'd the left aside.
O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,
Conduct us thou, he cried, on this new way,
 
Where now I venture, leading to the bourn
We seek. The universal world to thee
Owes warmth and lustre. If no other cause
 
Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.
Far, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,
In brief space had we journey'd; such prompt will
 
Impell'd; and towards us flying, now were heard
Spirits invisible, who courteously
Unto love's table bade the welcome guest.
 
The voice, that first? flew by, call'd forth aloud,
They have no wine; so on behind us past,
Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost
 
In the faint distance, when another came
Crying, I am Orestes, and alike
Wing'd its fleet way. Oh father! I exclaim'd,
 
What tongues are these? and as I question'd, lo!
A third exclaiming, Love ye those have wrong'd you.
This circuit, said my teacher, knots the scourge
 
For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn
By charity's correcting hand. The curb
Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear
 
(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,
Where pardon sets them free. But fix thine eyes
Intently through the air, and thou shalt see
 
A multitude before thee seated, each
Along the shelving grot. Then more than erst
I op'd my eyes, before me view'd, and saw
 
Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;
And when we pass'd a little forth, I heard
A crying, Blessed Mary! pray for us,
 
Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!
I do not think there walks on earth this day
Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn'd
 
With pity at the sight that next I saw.
Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now
I stood so near them, that their semblances
 
Came clearly to my view. Of sackcloth vile
Their cov'ring seem'd; and on his shoulder one
Did stay another, leaning, and all lean'd
 
Against the cliff. E'en thus the blind and poor,
Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,
Stand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk,
 
So most to stir compassion, not by sound
Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,
The sight of mis'ry. And as never beam
 
Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,
E'en so was heav'n a niggard unto these
Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,
 
A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,
As for the taming of a haggard hawk.
It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look
 
On others, yet myself the while unseen.
To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.
He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,
 
Nor waited for my questioning, but said:
Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.
On that part of the cornice, whence no rim
 
Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;
On the' other side me were the spirits, their cheeks
Bathing devout with penitential tears,
 
That through the dread impalement forc'd a way.
I turn'd me to them, and O shades! said I,
Assur'd that to your eyes unveil'd shall shine
 
The lofty light, sole object of your wish,
So may heaven's grace clear whatsoe'er of foam
Floats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth
 
The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,
As ye declare (for so shall ye impart
A boon I dearly prize) if any soul
 
Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance
That soul may profit, if I learn so much.
My brother, we are each one citizens
 
Of one true city. Any thou wouldst say,
Who lived a stranger in Italia's land.
So heard I answering, as appeal'd, a voice
 
That onward came some space from whence I stood.
A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark'd
Expectance. Ask ye how? The chin was rais'd
 
As in one reft of sight. Spirit, said I,
Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be
That which didst answer to me,) or by place
 
Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.
I was, it answer'd, of Sienna: here
I cleanse away with these the evil life,
 
Soliciting with tears that He, who is,
Vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam'd
In sapience I excell'd not, gladder far
 
Of others' hurt, than of the good befell me.
That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,
Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it.
 
When now my years slop'd waning down the arch,
It so bechanc'd, my fellow citizens
Near Colle met their enemies in the field,
 
And I pray'd God to grant what He had will'd.
There were they vanquish'd, and betook themselves
Unto the bitter passages of flight.
 
I mark'd the hunt, and waxing out of bounds
In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,
And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,
 
Cried, It is over. Heav'n! I fear thee not.
Upon my verge of life I wish'd for peace
With God; nor repentance had supplied
 
What I did lack of duty, were it not
The hermit Piero, touch'd with charity,
In his devout orisons thought on me.
 
But who art thou that question'st of our state,
Who go'st to my belief, with lids unclos'd,
And breathest in thy talk? --Mine eyes, said I,
 
May yet be here ta'en from me; but not long;
For they have not offended grievously
With envious glances. But the woe beneath
 
Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.
That nether load already weighs me down.
She thus: Who then amongst us here aloft
 
Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?
He, answer'd I, who standeth mute beside me.
I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,
 
If thou desire I yonder yet should move
For thee my mortal feet. --Oh! she replied,
This is so strange a thing, it is great sign
 
That God doth love thee. Therefore with thy prayer
Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,
Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet
 
E'er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame
Amongst my kindred. Them shalt thou behold
With that vain multitude, who set their hope
 
On Telamone's haven, there to fail
Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream
They sought of Dian call'd: but they who lead
 
Their navies, more than ruin'd hopes shall mourn.
