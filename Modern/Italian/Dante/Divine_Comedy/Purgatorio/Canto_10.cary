When we had passed the threshold of the gate
(Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,
Making the crooked seem the straighter path),
 
I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn'd,
For that offence what plea might have avail'd?
We mounted up the riven rock, that wound
 
On either side alternate, as the wave
Flies and advances. Here some little art
Behooves us, said my leader, that our steps
 
Observe the varying flexure of the path.
Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb
The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,
 
Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free
We came and open, where the mount above
One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,
 
And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,
Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads
That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink
 
Borders upon vacuity, to foot
Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space
Had measur'd thrice the stature of a man:
 
And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,
To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,
That cornice equal in extent appear'd.
 
Not yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,
When I discover'd that the bank around,
Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,
 
Was marble white, and so exactly wrought
With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone
Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self
 
Been sham'd. The angel who came down to earth
With tidings of the peace so many years
Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates
 
From their long interdict) before us seem'd,
In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,
He look'd no silent image. One had sworn
 
He had said, Hail! for she was imag'd there,
By whom the key did open to God's love,
And in her act as sensibly impress
 
That word, Behold the handmaid of the Lord,
As figure seal'd on wax. Fix not thy mind
On one place only, said the guide belov'd,
 
Who had me near him on that part where lies
The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn'd
And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,
 
Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,
Another story graven on the rock.
I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,
 
That it might stand more aptly for my view.
There in the self-same marble were engrav'd
The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,
 
That from unbidden office awes mankind.
Before it came much people; and the whole
Parted in seven quires. One sense cried, Nay,
 
Another, Yes, they sing. Like doubt arose
Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume
Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.
 
Preceding the blest vessel, onward came
With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,
Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd
 
Less and yet more than kingly. Opposite,
At a great palace, from the lattice forth
Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn
 
And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,
Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,
I mov'd me. There was storied on the rock
 
The' exalted glory of the Roman prince,
Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn
His mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.
 
A widow at his bridle stood, attir'd
In tears and mourning. Round about them troop'd
Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold
 
The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.
The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:
Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart
 
My son is murder'd. He replying seem'd;
Wait now till I return. And she, as one
Made hasty by her grief; O sire, if thou
 
Dost not return?--Where I am, who then is,
May right thee.-- What to thee is other's good,
If thou neglect thy own?--Now comfort thee,
 
At length he answers. It beseemeth well
My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:
So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.
 
He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd
That visible speaking, new to us and strange
The like not found on earth. Fondly I gaz'd
 
Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,
Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,
When Lo, the poet whisper'd, where this way
 
(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.
These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.
Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights
 
Their lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn.
Reader! I would not that amaz'd thou miss
Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God
 
Decrees our debts be cancel'd. Ponder not
The form of suff'ring. Think on what succeeds,
Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
 
It cannot pass. Instructor, I began,
What I see hither tending, bears no trace
Of human semblance, nor of aught beside
 
That my foil'd sight can guess. He answering thus:
So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems
Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first
 
Struggled as thine. But look intently thither,
An disentangle with thy lab'ring view,
What underneath those stones approacheth: now,
 
E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.
Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones!
That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust
 
Upon unstaid perverseness! Know ye not
That we are worms, yet made at last to form
The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes
 
That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?
Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?
Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,
 
Like the untimely embryon of a worm!
As, to support incumbent floor or roof,
For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,
 
That crumples up its knees unto its breast,
With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd
In the beholder's fancy; so I saw
 
These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.
Each, as his back was laden, came indeed
Or more or less contract; but it appear'd
 
As he, who show'd most patience in his look,
Wailing exclaim'd: I can endure no more.
