The natural thirst, ne'er quench'd but from the well,
Whereof the woman of Samaria crav'd,
Excited: haste along the cumber'd path,
 
After my guide, impell'd; and pity mov'd
My bosom for the 'vengeful deed, though just.
When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ
 
Appear'd unto the two upon their way,
New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us
A shade appear'd, and after us approach'd,
 
Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.
We were not ware of it; so first it spake,
Saying, God give you peace, my brethren! then
 
Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,
As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:
Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
 
Awarded by that righteous court, which me
To everlasting banishment exiles!
How! he exclaim'd, nor from his speed meanwhile
 
Desisting, If that ye be spirits, whom God
Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height
Has been thus far your guide? To whom the bard:
 
If thou observe the tokens, which this man
Trac'd by the finger of the angel bears,
'Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
 
He needs must share. But sithence she, whose wheel
Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn
That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil'd,
 
Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,
His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,
Not of herself could mount, for not like ours
 
Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf
Of hell was ta'en, to lead him, and will lead
Far as my lore avails. But, if thou know,
 
Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile
Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once
Seem'd shouting, even from his wave-wash'd foot.
 
That questioning so tallied with my wish,
The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
E'en from expectance. He forthwith replied,
 
In its devotion nought irregular
This mount can witness, or by punctual rule
Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt.
 
Other than that, which heaven in itself
Doth of itself receive, no influence
Can reach us. Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,
 
Hoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls
Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds
Nor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance
 
Ne'er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,
That yonder often shift on each side heav'n.
Vapour adust doth never mount above
 
The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon
Peter's vicegerent stands. Lower perchance,
With various motion rock'd, trembles the soil:
 
But here, through wind in earth's deep hollow pent,
I know not how, yet never trembled: then
Trembles, when any spirit feels itself
 
So purified, that it may rise, or move
For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues.
Purification by the will alone
 
Is prov'd, that free to change society
Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.
Desire of bliss is present from the first;
 
But strong propension hinders, to that wish
By the just ordinance of heav'n oppos'd;
Propension now as eager to fulfil
 
Th' allotted torment, as erewhile to sin.
And I who in this punishment had lain
Five hundred years and more, but now have felt
 
Free wish for happier clime. Therefore thou felt'st
The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout
Heard'st, over all his limits, utter praise
 
To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy
To hasten. Thus he spake: and since the draught
Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,
 
No words may speak my fullness of content.
Now, said the instructor sage, I see the net
That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos'd,
 
Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.
Vouchsafe, that from thy lips I next may learn,
Who on the earth thou wast, and wherefore here
 
So many an age wert prostrate. --In that time,
When the good Titus, with Heav'n's King to help,
Aveng'd those piteous gashes, whence the blood
 
By Judas sold did issue, with the name
Most lasting and most honour'd there was I
Abundantly renown'd, the shade reply'd,
 
Not yet with faith endued. So passing sweet
My vocal Spirit, from Tolosa, Rome
To herself drew me, where I merited
 
A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow.
Statius they name me still. Of Thebes I sang,
And next of great Achilles: but i' th' way
 
Fell with the second burthen. Of my flame
Those sparkles were the seeds, which I deriv'd
From the bright fountain of celestial fire
 
That feeds unnumber'd lamps, the song I mean
Which sounds Aeneas' wand'rings: that the breast
I hung at, that the nurse, from whom my veins
 
Drank inspiration: whose authority
Was ever sacred with me. To have liv'd
Coeval with the Mantuan, I would bide
 
The revolution of another sun
Beyond my stated years in banishment.
The Mantuan, when he heard him, turn'd to me,
 
And holding silence: by his countenance
Enjoin'd me silence but the power which wills,
Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears
 
Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,
They wait not for the motions of the will
In natures most sincere. I did but smile,
 
As one who winks; and thereupon the shade
Broke off, and peer'd into mine eyes, where best
Our looks interpret. So to good event
 
Mayst thou conduct such great emprize, he cried,
Say, why across thy visage beam'd, but now,
The lightning of a smile! On either part
 
Now am I straiten'd; one conjures me speak,
Th' other to silence binds me: whence a sigh
I utter, and the sigh is heard. Speak on;
 
The teacher cried; and do not fear to speak,
But tell him what so earnestly he asks.
Whereon I thus: Perchance, O ancient spirit!
 
Thou marvel'st at my smiling. There is room
For yet more wonder. He who guides my ken
On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom
 
Thou didst presume of men arid gods to sing.
If other cause thou deem'dst for which I smil'd,
Leave it as not the true one; and believe
 
Those words, thou spak'st of him, indeed the cause.
Now down he bent t' embrace my teacher's feet;
But he forbade him: Brother! do it not:
 
Thou art a shadow, and behold'st a shade.
He rising answer'd thus: Now hast thou prov'd
The force and ardour of the love I bear thee,
 
When I forget we are but things of air,
And as a substance treat an empty shade.
