It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need
To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now
To Taurus the meridian circle left,
 
And to the Scorpion left the night. As one
That makes no pause, but presses on his road,
Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need
 
Impel: so enter'd we upon our way,
One before other; for, but singly, none
That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.
 
E'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing
Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit
The nest, and drops it; so in me desire
 
Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,
Arriving even to the act, that marks
A man prepar'd for speech. Him all our haste
 
Restrain'd not, but thus spake the sire belov'd:
Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip
Stands trembling for its flight. Encourag'd thus
 
I straight began: How there can leanness come,
Where is no want of nourishment to feed?
If thou, he answer'd, hadst remember'd thee,
 
How Meleager with the wasting brand
Wasted alike, by equal fires consm'd,
This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,
 
How in the mirror your reflected form
With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems
Hard, had appear'd no harder than the pulp
 
Of summer fruit mature. But that thy will
In certainty may find its full repose,
Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray
 
That he would now be healer of thy wound.
If in thy presence I unfold to him
The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let me plead
 
Thine own injunction, to exculpate me.
So Statius answer'd, and forthwith began:
Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind
 
Receive them: so shall they be light to clear
The doubt thou offer'st. Blood, concocted well,
Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbib'd,
 
And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en
From the replenish'd table, in the heart
Derives effectual virtue, that informs
 
The several human limbs, as being that,
Which passes through the veins itself to make them.
Yet more concocted it descends, where shame
 
Forbids to mention: and from thence distils
In natural vessel on another's blood.
Then each unite together, one dispos'd
 
T' endure, to act the other, through meet frame
Of its recipient mould: that being reach'd,
It 'gins to work, coagulating first;
 
Then vivifies what its own substance caus'd
To bear. With animation now indued,
The active virtue (differing from a plant
 
No further, than that this is on the way
And at its limit that) continues yet
To operate, that now it moves, and feels,
 
As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there
Assumes th' organic powers its seed convey'd.
'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,
 
That from the generating heart proceeds,
Is pliant and expansive; for each limb
Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann'd.
 
How babe of animal becomes, remains
For thy consid'ring. At this point, more wise,
Than thou hast err'd, making the soul disjoin'd
 
From passive intellect, because he saw
No organ for the latter's use assign'd.
Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.
 
Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,
Articulation is complete, then turns
The primal Mover with a smile of joy
 
On such great work of nature, and imbreathes
New spirit replete with virtue, that what here
Active it finds, to its own substance draws,
 
And forms an individual soul, that lives,
And feels, and bends reflective on itself.
And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,
 
Mark the sun's heat, how that to wine doth change,
Mix'd with the moisture filter'd through the vine.
When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul
 
Takes with her both the human and divine,
Memory, intelligence, and will, in act
Far keener than before, the other powers
 
Inactive all and mute. No pause allow'd,
In wond'rous sort self-moving, to one strand
Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,
 
Here learns her destin'd path. Soon as the place
Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,
Distinct as in the living limbs before:
 
And as the air, when saturate with showers,
The casual beam refracting, decks itself
With many a hue; so here the ambient air
 
Weareth that form, which influence of the soul
Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where
The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth
 
The new form on the spirit follows still:
Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call'd,
With each sense even to the sight endued:
 
Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs
Which thou mayst oft have witness'd on the mount
Th' obedient shadow fails not to present
 
Whatever varying passion moves within us.
And this the cause of what thou marvel'st at.
Now the last flexure of our way we reach'd,
 
And to the right hand turning, other care
Awaits us. Here the rocky precipice
Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim
 
A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff
Driveth them back, sequester'd from its bound.
Behoov'd us, one by one, along the side,
 
That border'd on the void, to pass; and I
Fear'd on one hand the fire, on th' other fear'd
Headlong to fall: when thus th' instructor warn'd:
 
Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.
A little swerving and the way is lost.
Then from the bosom of the burning mass,
 
O God of mercy! heard I sung; and felt
No less desire to turn. And when I saw
Spirits along the flame proceeding, I
 
Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
To share by turns my view. At the hymn's close
They shouted loud, I do not know a man;
 
Then in low voice again took up the strain,
Which once more ended, To the wood, they cried,
Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung
 
With Cytherea's poison: then return'd
Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll'd,
Who liv'd in virtue chastely, and the bands
 
Of wedded love. Nor from that task, I ween,
Surcease they; whilesoe'er the scorching fire
Enclasps them. Of such skill appliance needs
 
To medicine the wound, that healeth last.
