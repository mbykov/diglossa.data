*406 In the very first sentence of Confessions, Bk. I, Ch. I. Here we have a basic and recurrent motif of the Confessions from beginning to end: the celebration and praise of the greatness and goodness of God--Creator and Redeemer. The repetition of it here connects this concluding section of the Confessions, Bks. XI-XIII, with the preceding part.
*407 Matt. 6:8.
*408 The "virtues" of the Beatitudes, the reward for which is blessedness; cf. Matt. 5:1-11.
*409 Ps. 118:1; cf. Ps. 136.
*410 An interesting symbol of time's ceaseless passage; the reference is to a water clock (clepsydra).
*411 Cf. Ps. 130:1, De profundis.
*412 Ps. 74:16.
*413 This metaphor is probably from Ps. 29:9.
*414 A repetition of the metaphor above, Bk. IX, Ch. VII, 16.
*415 Ps. 26:7.
*416 Ps. 119:18.
*417 Cf. Matt. 6:33.
*418 Col. 2:3.
*419 Augustine was profoundly stirred, in mind and heart, by the great mystery of creation and the Scriptural testimony about it. In addition to this long and involved analysis of time and creation which follows here, he returned to the story in Genesis repeatedly: e.g., De Genesi contra Manicheos; De Genesi ad litteram, liber imperfectus (both written before the Confessions); De Genesi ad litteram, libri XII and De civitate Dei, XI-XII (both written after the Confessions).
*420 The final test of truth, for Augustine, is self-evidence and the final source of truth is the indwelling Logos.
*421 Cf. the notion of creation in Plato's Timaeus (29D-30C; 48E-50C), in which the Demiurgos (craftsman) fashions the universe from pre-existent matter (το υποδοχη) and imposes as much form as the Receptacle will receive. The notion of the world fashioned from pre-existent matter of some sort was a universal idea in Greco-Roman cosmology.
*422 Cf. Ps. 33:9.
*423 Matt. 3:17.
*424 Cf. the Vulgate of John 8:25.
*425 Cf. Augustine's emphasis on Christ as true Teacher in De Magistro.
*426 Cf. John 3:29.
*427 Cf. Ps. 103:4, 5 (mixed text).
*428 Ps. 104:24.
*429 Pleni vetustatis suae. In Sermon CCLXVII, 2 (PL 38, c. 1230), Augustine has a similar usage. Speaking of those who pour new wine into old containers, he says: Carnalitas vetustas est, gratia novitas est, "Carnality is the old nature; grace is the new"; cf. Matt. 9:17. 430The notion of the eternity of this world was widely held in Greek philosophy, in different versions, and was incorporated into the Manichean rejection of the Christian doctrine of creatio ex nihilo which Augustine is citing here. He returns to the question, and his answer to it, again in De civitate
*Dei, XI, 4-8.
*431 The unstable "heart" of those who confuse time and eternity.
*432 Cf. Ps. 102:27.
*433 Ps. 2:7.
*434 Spatium, which means extension either in space or time.
*435 The breaking light and the image of the rising sun.
*436 Cf. Ps. 139:6.
*437 Memoria, contuitus, and expectatio: a pattern that corresponds vaguely to the movement of Augustine's thought in the Confessions: from direct experience back to the supporting memories and forward to the outreach of hope and confidence in God's provident grace.
*438 Cf. Ps. 116:10.
*439 Cf. Matt. 25:21, 23.
*440 Communes notitias, the universal principles of "common sense." This idea became a basic category in scholastic epistemology.
*441 Gen. 1:14.
*442 Cf. Josh. 10:12-14.
*443 Cf. Ps. 18:28.
*444 Cubitum, literally the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger; in the imperial system of weights and measures it was 17.5 inches.
*445 Distentionem, "spread-out-ness"; cf. Descartes' notion of res extensae, and its relation to time.
*446 Ps. 100:3.
*447 Here Augustine begins to summarize his own answers to the questions he has raised in his analysis of time.
*448 The same hymn of Ambrose quoted above, Bk. IX, Ch. XII, 39, and analyzed again in De musica,
*VI, 2:2.
*449 This theory of time is worth comparing with its most notable restatement in modern poetry, in
*450 Ps. 63:3.
*451 Cf. Phil. 3:12-14.
*452 Cf. Ps. 31:10.
*453 Note here the preparation for the transition from this analysis of time in Bk. XI to the exploration of the mystery of creation in Bks. XII and XIII.
*454 Celsitudo, an honorific title, somewhat like "Your Highness."
