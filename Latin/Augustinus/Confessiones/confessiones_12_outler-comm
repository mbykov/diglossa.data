*455 Rom. 8:31.
*456 Matt. 7:7, 8.
*457 Vulgate, Ps. 113:16 (cf. Ps. 115:16, K.J.; see also Ps. 148:4, both Vulgate and K.J.): Caelum caeli domino, etc. Augustine finds a distinction here for which the Hebrew text gives no warrant. The Hebrew is a typical nominal sentence and means simply "The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh"; cf. the Soncino edition of The Psalms, edited by A. Cohen; cf. also R.S.V., Ps. 115:16. The LXX reading (ο ουρανοζ του ουρανου) seems to rest on a variant Hebrew text. This idiomatic construction does not mean "the heavens of the heavens" (as it is too literally translated in the LXX), but rather "highest heaven." This is a familiar way, in Hebrew, of emphasizing a superlative (e.g., "King of kings," "Song of songs"). The singular thing can be described superlatively only in terms of itself!
*458 Earth and sky.
*459 It is interesting that Augustine should have preferred the invisibilis et incomposita of the Old Latin version of Gen. 1:2 over the inanis et vacua of the Vulgate, which was surely accessible to him. Since this is to be a key phrase in the succeeding exegesis this reading can hardly have been the casual citation of the old and familiar version. Is it possible that Augustine may have had the sensibilities and associations of his readers in mind--for many of them may have not known Jerome's version or, at least, not very well?
*460 Abyssus, literally, the unplumbed depths of the sea, and as a constant meaning here, "the depths beyond measure."
*461 Gen. 1:2.
*462 Augustine may not have known the Platonic doctrine of nonbeing (cf. Sophist, 236C-237B), but he clearly is deeply influenced here by Plotinus; cf. Enneads, II, 4:8f., where matter is analyzed as a substratum without quantity or quality; and 4:15: "Matter, then, must be described as το απειρον (the indefinite). . . . Matter is indeterminateness and nothing else." In short, materia informis is sheer possibility; not anything and not nothing!
*463 Dictare: was Augustine dictating his Confessions? It is very probable.
*464 Visibiles et compositas, the opposite of "invisible and unformed."
*465 Isa. 6:3; Rev. 4:8.
*466 De nihilo.
*467 Trina unitas.
*468 Cf. Gen. 1:6.
*469 Constat et non constat, the created earth really exists but never is self-sufficient.
*470 Moses.
*471 Ps. 42:3, 10.
*472 Cor. 13:12.
*473 Cf. Ecclus. 1:4.
*474 2 Cor. 5:21.
*475 Cf. Gal. 4:26.
*476 2 Cor. 5:1.
*477 Cf. Ps. 26:8.
*478 Ps. 119:176.
*479 To "the house of God."
*480 Cf. Ps. 28:1.
*481 Cubile, i.e., the heart.
*482 Cf. Rom. 8:26.
*483 The heavenly Jerusalem of Gal. 4:26, which had become a favorite Christian symbol of the peace and blessedness of heaven; cf. the various versions of the hymn "Jerusalem, My Happy Home" in Julian's Dictionary of Hymnology, pp. 580-583. The original text is found in the Liber meditationum, erroneously ascribed to Augustine himself.
*484 Cf. 2 Tim. 2:14.
*485 1 Tim. 1:5.
*486 This is the basis of Augustine's defense of allegory as both legitimate and profitable in the
*interpretation of Scripture. He did not mean that there is a plurality of literal truths in Scripture but a multiplicity of perspectives on truth which amounted to different levels and interpretations of truth. This gave Augustine the basis for a positive tolerance of varying interpretations which did hold fast to the essential common premises about God's primacy as Creator; cf. M. Pontet, L'Exégèse de Saint Augustin prédicateur (Lyons, 1944), chs. II and III.
*487 In this chapter, Augustine summarizes what he takes to be the Christian consensus on the questions he has explored about the relation of the intellectual and corporeal creations.
*488 Cf. 1 Cor. 8:6.
*489 Mole mundi.
*490 Cf. Col. 1:16.
*491 Gen. 1:9.
*492 Note how this reiterates a constant theme in the Confessions as a whole; a further indication that
*Bk. XII is an integral part of the single whole.
*493 Cf. De libero arbitrio, II, 8:20, 10:28.
*494 Cf. John 8:44.
*495 The essential thesis of the De Magistro; it has important implications both for Augustine's epistemology and for his theory of Christian nurture; cf. the De catechizandis rudibus.
*496 1 Cor. 4:6.
*497 Cf. Deut. 6:5; Lev. 19:18; see also Matt. 22:37, 39.
*498 Cf. Rom. 9:21.
*499 Cf. Ps. 8:4.
*500 "In the beginning God created," etc.
*501 An echo of Job 39:13-16.
*502 The thicket denizens mentioned above.
*503 Cf. Ps. 143:10.
*504 Something of an understatement! It is interesting to note that Augustine devotes more time and space to these opening verses of Genesis than to any other passage in the entire Bible--and he never commented on the full text of Genesis. Cf. Karl Barth's 274 pages devoted to Gen., chs. 1;2, in the Kirchliche Dogmatik, III, I, pp. 103-377.
*505 Transition, in preparation for the concluding book (XIII), which undertakes a constructive resolution to the problem of the analysis of the mode of creation made here in Bk. XII.
