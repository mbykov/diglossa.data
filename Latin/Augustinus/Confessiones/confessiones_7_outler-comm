*176 Thirty years old; although the term "youth" (juventus) normally included the years twenty to forty.
*177 Phantasmata, mental constructs, which may be internally coherent but correspond to no reality outside the mind.
*178 Echoes here of Plato's Timaeus and Plotinus' Enneads, although with no effort to recall the sources or elaborate the ontological theory.
*179 Cf. the famous "definition" of God in Anselm's ontological argument: "that being than whom no greater can be conceived." Cf. Proslogium, II-V.
*180 This simile is Augustine's apparently original improvement on Plotinus' similar figure of the net in the sea; Enneads, IV, 3:9.
*181 Gen. 25:21 to 33:20.
*182 Cf. Job 15:26 (Old Latin version).
*183 Cf. Ps. 103:9-14.
*184 James 4:6.
*185 Cf. John 1:14
*186 It is not altgether clear as to which "books" and which "Platonists" are here referred to. The succeeding analysis of "Platonism" does not resemble any single known text closely enough to allow for identification. The most reasonable conjecture, as most authorities agree, is that the "books" here mentioned were the Enneads of Plotinus, which Marius Victorinus (q.v. infra, Bk. VIII, Ch. II, 3-5) had translated into Latin several years before; cf. M.P. Garvey, St. Augustine: Christian or Neo- Platonist (Milwaukee, 1939). There is also a fair probability that Augustine had acquired some knowledge of the Didaskalikos of Albinus; cf. R.E. Witt, Albinus and the History of Middle Platonism (Cambridge, 1937).
*187 Cf. this mixed quotation of John 1:1-10 with the Fifth Ennead and note Augustine's identification of Logos, in the Fourth Gospel, with Nous in Plotinus.
*188 John 1:11, 12
*189 John 1:13.
*190 John 1:14.
*191 Phil. 2:6.
*192 Phil. 2:7-11.
*193 Rom. 5:6; 8:32.
*194 Luke 10:21.
*195 Cf. Matt. 11:28, 29.
*196 Cf. Ps. 25:9, 18.
*197 Matt. 11:29.
*198 Rom. 1:21, 22.
*199 Rom. 1:23.
*200 An echo of Porphyry's De abstinentia ab esu animalium.
*201 The allegorical interpretation of the Israelites' despoiling the Egyptians (Ex. 12:35, 36) made it refer to the liberty of Christian thinkers in appropriating whatever was good and true from the pagan philosophers of the Greco-Roman world. This was a favorite theme of Clement of Alexandria and Origen and was quite explicitly developed in Origen's Epistle to Gregory Thaumaturgus (ANF, IX, pp. 295, 296); cf. Augustine, On Christian Doctrine, II, 41-42.
*202 Cf. Acts 17:28.
*203 Cf. Rom. 1:25.
*204 Cf. Ps. 39:11.
*205 Some MSS. add "immo vero" ("yea, verily"), but not the best ones; cf. De Labriolle, op. cit., I, p.
*206 Rom. 1:20.
*207 A locus classicus of the doctrine of the privative character of evil and the positive character of the good. This is a fundamental premise in Augustine's metaphysics: it reappears in Bks. XII-XIII, in the Enchiridion, and elsewhere (see note, infra, p. 343). This doctrine of the goodness of all creation is taken up into the scholastic metaphysics; cf. Confessions, Bks. XII-XIII, and Thomas Aquinas, Summa contra gentes, II: 45.
*208 Ps. 148:7-12.
*209 Ps. 148:1-5.
*210 "The evil which overtakes us has its source in self-will, in the entry into the sphere of process and in the primal assertion of the desire for self-ownership" (Plotinus, Enneads, V, 1:1).
*211 "We have gone weighed down from beneath; the vision is frustrated" (Enneads, VI, 9:4).
*212 Rom. 1:20.
*213 The Plotinian Nous.
*214 This is an astonishingly candid and plain account of a Plotinian ecstasy, the pilgrimage of the soul from its absorption in things to its rapturous but momentary vision of the One; cf. especially the Sixth Ennead, 9:3-11, for very close parallels in thought and echoes of language. This is one of two ecstatic visions reported in the Confessions; the other is, of course, the last great moment with his mother at Ostia (Bk. IX, Ch. X, 23-25). One comes before the "conversion" in the Milanese garden (Bk. VIII, Ch. XII, 28-29); the other, after. They ought to be compared with particular interest in their similarities as well as their significant differences. Cf. also K.E. Kirk, The Vision of God (London, 1932), pp. 319-346.
*215 1 Tim. 2:5.
*216 Rom. 9:5.
*217 John 14:6.
*218 An interesting reminder that the Apollinarian heresy was condemned but not extinct.
*219 It is worth remembering that both Augustine and Alypius were catechumens and had presumably been receiving doctrinal instruction in preparation for their eventual baptism and full membership in the Catholic Church. That their ideas on the incarnation, at this stage, were in such confusionraises an interesting problem.
*220 Cf. Augustine's The Christian Combat as an example of "the refutation of heretics."
*221 Cf. 1 Cor. 11:19.
*222 Non peritus, sed periturus essem.
*223 Cf. 1 Cor. 3:11f.
*224 Rom. 7:22, 23.
*225 Rom. 7:24, 25.
*226 Cf. Prov. 8:22 and Col. 1:15. Augustine is here identifying the figure of Wisdom in Proverbs with the figure of the Logos in the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel. In the Arian controversy both these references to God's Wisdom and Word as "created" caused great difficulty for the orthodox, for the Arians triumphantly appealed to them as proof that Jesus Christ was a "creature" of God. But Augustine was a Chalcedonian before Chalcedon, and there is no doubt that he is here quoting familiar Scripture and filling it with the interpretation achieved by the long struggle of the Church to affirm the coeternity and consubstantiality of Jesus Christ and God the Father.
*227 Cf. Ps. 62:1, 2, 5, 6.
*228 Cf. Ps. 91:13.
