Chapter Ten

The Yoga of Divine glories

The Holy Lord said: 

Now hear from Me the supreme word Which I speak to you, Mighty-Armed,  / For you are beloved to Me. I speak desiring your welfare. (1)

Neither the multitude of gods Or great seers know My origin.  / In truth I am the source of the Gods, as well as of the great seers. (2)

He who knows Me as birthless and Beginningless, the world’s Great Lord– / He alone among mortals is Undeluded and freed from sins. (3)

Reason, knowledge, non-delusion, Forbearance, truth, restraint of sense, / Calmness, happiness, misery, Birth, death, fear, also fearlessness, (4)

Non-injury, and contentment,1 Austerity, benevolence,  / Both good repute and ill repute– All these arise from Me alone. (5)

The ancient Seven Great Rishis2 And Four Manus,3 with pow’rs like Me,  / Were born of My mind, and from them Are all the creatures in this world. (6)

He who knows all these manifold Manifestations of My pow’r  / And glory, becomes established In yoga–there can be no doubt. (7)

I am the origin of all, And from Me ev’rything evolves– / Thinking thus, the wise worship Me With consciousness all filled with love. (8)

With minds and lives intent on Me, Enlightening4 one another,  / And speaking of Me constantly, They are content and do rejoice. (9)

To them, the constantly steadfast, Worshipping Me with affection, / I bestow the buddhi-yoga By which they shall come unto Me. (10)

Out of compassion for them, I, Abiding in their hearts, destroy  / The darkness born of ignorance By the shining lamp of knowledge. (11)

Arjuna said: 

Supreme Brahman, Supreme Abode, Supreme Purifier, Divine, / Eternal Person, the First God, The Birthless and All-pervading– (12)

Thus all the sages declare You: Narad’,5 Asita Devala,6  / And Vyasa7–and now do You, too, Yourself declare it unto me. (13)

I regard all this that You say To me as true, O Keshava. / In truth, neither gods nor demons Know of Your manifestation. (14)

For You know Yourself by Yourself, O You, the Supreme Purusha8:  / Source of beings, Lord of beings, God of gods, Ruler of the world. (15)

You should now describe completely Your divine manifestations  / By which, pervading all these worlds, You do abide within all things. (16)

How may I know You, O Yogi, Always meditating on You? / In what aspects of Your Being Are You to be thought of by me? (17)

Explain to me in more detail Your pow’rs and manifestations. / I am never satiated In hearing Your amrit-like9 words. (18)

The Holy Lord said: 

Listen! I shall tell you of My Divine Self-manifestations;  / But only the chief ones, because There is no end to My expanse. (19)

Arjuna, there is no end of My divine manifestations.  / What I have spoken unto you Is but an example of them. (40)

Whatever is glorious or Prosperous or yet powerful,  / Understand that springs from but a Fraction of My radiant Pow’r. (41)

Of what value is it for you To know all this, O Arjuna? / I ever support this whole world By just one portion of Myself. (42)
