Canto I

*

MIDWAY upon the journey of our life / I found myself within a forest dark, / For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say / What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, / Which in the very thought renews the fear.

So bitter is it, death is little more; / But of the good to treat, which there I found, / Speak will I of the other things I saw there.

I cannot well repeat how there I entered, / So full was I of slumber at the moment / In which I had abandoned the true way.

But after I had reached a mountain's foot, / At that point where the valley terminated, / Which had with consternation pierced my heart,

Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders / Vested already with that planet's rays / Which leadeth others right by every road.

Then was the fear a little quieted / That in my heart's lake had endured throughout / The night, which I had passed so piteously

And even as he, who, with distressful breath, / Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, / Turns to the water perilous and gazes;

So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, / Turn itself back to re-behold the pass / Which never yet a living person left.

After my weary body I had rested, / The way resumed I on the desert slope, / So that the firm foot ever was the lower.

And lo! almost where the ascent began, / A panther light and swift exceedingly, / Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!

And never moved she from before my face, / Nay, rather did impede so much my way, / That many times I to return had turned.

The time was the beginning of the morning, / And up the sun was mounting with those stars / That with him were, what time the Love Divine

At first in motion set those beauteous things; / So were to me occasion of good hope, / The variegaled skin of that wild beast,

The hour of time, and the delicious season; / But not so much, that did not give me fear / A lion's aspect which appeared to me.

He seemed as if against me he were coming / With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger, / So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;

And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings / Seemed to be laden in her meagreness, / And many folk has caused to live forlorn!

She brought upon me so much heaviness, / With the affright that from her aspect came, / That I the hope relinquished of the height.

And as he is who willingly acquires / And the time comes that causes him to lose, / Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,

E'en such made me that beast withouten peace, / Which, coming on against me by degrees / Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent

While I was rushing downward to the lowland, / Before mine eyes did one present himself, / Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.

When I beheld him in the desert vast, / Have pity on me, unto him I cried, / Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!

He answered me: Not man; man once I was, / And both my parents were of Lombardy, / And Mantuans by country both of them.

Sub Julio was I born, though it was late, / And lived at Rome under the good Augustus, / During the time of false and Iying gods.

A poet was I, and I sang that just / Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy, / After that Ilion the superb was burned

But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance? / Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable / Which is the source and cause of every joy?

Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain / Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech? / I made response to him with bashful forehead.

O, of the other poets honour and light, / Avail me the long study and great love / That have impelled me to explore thy volume!

Thou art my master, and my author thou, / Thou art alone the one from whom I took / The beautiful style that has done honour to me.

Behold the beast, for which I have turned back; / Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage, / For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.'

Thee it behoves to take another road, / Responded he, when he beheld me weeping, / If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;

Because this beast, at which thou criest out, / Suffers not any one to pass her way, / But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;

And has a nature so malign and ruthless, / That never doth she glut her greedy will, / And after food is hungrier than before.

Many the animals with whom she weds, / And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound / Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.

He shall not feed on either earth or pelf, / But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue; / 'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;

Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour, / On whose account the maid Camilla died, / Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;

Through every city shall he hunt her down, / Until he shall have driven her back to Hell, / There from whence envy first did let her loose.

Therefore I think and judge it for thy best / Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, / And lead thee hence through the eternal place,

Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations, / Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate, / Who cry out each one for the second death;

And thou shalt see those who contented are / Within the fire, because they hope to come, / Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;

To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend, / A soul shall be for that than I more worthy; / With her at my departure I will leave thee;

Because that Emperor, who reigns above, / In that I was rebellious to his law, / Wills that through me none come into his city.

governs evervwhere and there he reigns: / There is his city and his lofty throne; / O happy he whom thereto he elects!

And I to him: Poet, I thee entreat, / By that same God whom thou didst never know, / So that I may escape this woe and worse,

Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said, / That I may see the portal of Saint Peter, / And those thou makest so disconsolable.

Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
